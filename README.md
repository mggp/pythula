# Python Code Review App

This app is a sample project that integrates AI and LLM technologies to analyze Python code snippets. Users can input Python code, and the app provides a structured review consisting of a purpose summary, potential bugs or risks, and improvement suggestions. The app is designed to showcase the integration of OpenAI's SDK and PyTorch in a modern web application.

The system is divided into three main components: a React-based frontend for user interaction, a FastAPI backend for handling requests, and a small AI pipeline that includes a PyTorch classifier.
